# ND-Help
Codefundo++ project
 
       The peer to peer help is too important in Natural Disasters. The app "ND-Help" matches the people who need the help with the people who have resources and are nearer in the locality. Also, this app will take surveys so that helping organizations can determine what are the percentages of each type of requirements. In this app there will be mainly two option helper and help-seeker, the help-seeker will choose the needed help categories (like food, shelter etc.) and quantity. The app will automatically detect the location or ask help-seeker to provide the locality info. and locality photos, then it automatically creates a post and makes it reach to some nearest helper in the locality. The helper also mentions what resources he/she has and the locality. Moreover, if there is no internet the app will send a personal message automatically to the helpers. The helper has to choose some Help-seekers when he/she does so the app will give the helpers identity and contact details to the help-seeker and the post gets vanished.
